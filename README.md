Game Plan:

1. Segementation - isolate the number from the card

2. Feature Extraction - SIFT

3. Feature Matching - KNN implementation(?) 

  3.1 Offline - Preprocess cards, i.e. "training" samples, from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/jamesmcguigan/playingcards?select=2D.png)

  3.2 Match real time input to one of the "training" samples
  
4. Write the result to screen
